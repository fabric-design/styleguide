> Only pass through changed files

No more wasting precious time on processing unchanged files.

By default it's only able to detect whether files in the stream changed. If you require something more advanced like knowing if imports/dependencies changed, create a custom comparator, or use [another plugin](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp#incremental-builds).

How is this different from [gulp-changed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-changed)? `gulp-changed` checks against build files, for example ES5 files generated by Babel.js from the source ES6 files. `gulp-changed-in-places` monitors source files, ES6 files in this example. This allows you to do things like apply source formatting or linting only to changed files while you are working on them.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-changed-in-place
```

## Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var changedInPlace = require('gulp-changed-in-place');
var tsfmt = require('gulp-tsfmt');

gulp.task('default', function () {
  return gulp.src('src/**/*.{ts,tsx}')
    .pipe(changedInPlace())
    .pipe(tsfmt())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('src'));
});
```

## API

### changed(options)

* `firstPass` - `boolean` (Default `false`) - Makes `gulp-changed-in-place` pass through all files once on the first run.
* `cache` - `Object` (Default global variable) - Object that contains all SHA hashes.
