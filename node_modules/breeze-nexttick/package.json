In node it will use `process.nextTick`, but in the browser it will attempt\nto use `postMessage`. If either of the previous are not available, it will default to `setTimeout(fn, 0)`. \n\n```js\nvar nextTick = require('breeze-nexttick');\n\nnextTick(function () {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n#### License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jake Luer <jake@qualiancy.com> (http://qualiancy.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
